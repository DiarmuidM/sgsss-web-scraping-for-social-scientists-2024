# Web scraping for social scientists

## Introduction

There is an unprecedented amount of information on the internet that could usefully be harvested in order to build social science research datasets.

This half-day course will showcase suitable techniques for web scraping.

The value, logic and process of capturing data stored on websites will be described in detail, and practical examples and exercises will be demonstrated using the Python programming language.

It is most suited to empirical social science researchers but will be of value to researchers from a wide range of disciplines (e.g., digital humanities).

## Course materials

This repository houses the materials underpinning a [half-day SGSSS course on web scraping](https://social.sgsss.ac.uk/event/summer-school-2024-web-scraping-for-social-scientists) run by [Dr Diarmuid McDonnell](https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/persons/diarmuid-mcdonnell), University of the West of Scotland. The course was first run on 2024-06-05.
